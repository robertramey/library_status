# special notes for Xcode.

# these three should result in CMake setting the variables
# Boost_SERIALIZATION_LIBRARY_DEBUG … to the correct values.  

# But my current version of CMake doesn't automatically set the library names
# to point to the the libraries to be used.  The variables are created
# but they are not initialized.  So be prepared to set these variables by hand.
# If you want to use the static libraries - point to the boost libraries ending
# in ".a".  If you want to use the shared boost libraries - point to the libraries
# ending in ".dylib".

# But wait - there's more.
# if both lib.a and lib.dylib both exist in the library directory, Xcode will
# automatically chose the *.dylib one - and there's nothing you can do to fix this.
# So my recommendation is 
# a) to place the compiled libraries in two different directories
#    - e.g. stage/lib-static/*.a and stage/lib-shared/*.dylib
#    and set the CMake variable Boost_LIBRARY_DIR to point to one or the other
# b) create two different CMake build directories - build-static and build-shared
#    and switch between the generated projects as desired.  I like to test both since
#    there are things like dead code elimination and visibility which vary
#    between the two environments.
#
#    caveat - as I write this, I've been unable to get the tests on the shared
#    library to function. Problem is that one needs to either put the shared
#    libraries in a special known place or set an environmental
#    variable which points to the shared library directory.  I prefer the latter
#    but I've been unable to figure out how to get Xcode to do on a global basis
#    and it's not practical to do this for 247 test targets one at a time.

# c) The targets in the project will by default be built as universal 32/64 binaries
#    in debug mode.  When working with the
